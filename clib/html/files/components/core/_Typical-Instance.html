	(<a href="javascript:parent.code.dispatch('description')">description</a> ("Instances of this class are things that do not necessarily exist but serve to represent what is typical of instances of some class.  Instances of this class should be instances of another class which we refer to here as the reference class.  The name of instances of this class should be of the form `*Typical-Instance-of-Foo' such that Foo corresponds to its reference class.  For example, to express the fact that `It is typical for some laptop computers to have a sound card' one could reify *Typical-Instance-of-Laptop-Computer and assert that it has a Sound-Card as a part.  In contrast, see <a href="javascript:parent.code.dispatch('Detailed-Instance')">Detailed-Instance</a>."))
