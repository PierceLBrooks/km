<hr><i>
This is the top level concept for Events that have to do with being,
not changing. States represent relatively temporally unstable properties
and relations of an Entity. There are often <a href="javascript: void parent.code.goToSpec('Action');">Action</a>s
that cause Entities to be in States or change from one State to another.<p>

Since States can be thought of as snapshots of slot values associated with
Entities, it can be confusing whether an Entity having a slot indicates
a State or merely an intrinsic property of the Entity. Rather than join
the argument on properties vs. states (or even that of entities vs. sets of
properties), we include a State Event, which can be used to package 
property values of Entities and relations between Entities that:<ol>
<li>may be changed by <a href="javascript: void parent.code.goToSpec('Action');">Action</a>s
<li>are not usually thought of as properties of an Entity independent of context
<li>are grouped commonly enough to be lexicalized (to some degree)
</ol>
